# Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)

What is ALU?
\
**Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)** is an integrated circuit in a CPU or GPU which performs arithmetic and logic operations. The arithmetic instructions include addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and shifting operations, while logic operations include AND, OR, XOR, and NOT operations.

The inputs to an ALU are the data to be operated on, called operands, and a code indicating the operation to be performed; the ALU's output is the result of the performed operation.
