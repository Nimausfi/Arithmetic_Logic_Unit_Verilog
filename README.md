# Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)

**What is ALU?**
\
\
**Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)** is an integrated circuit in a CPU or GPU which performs arithmetic and logic operations. The arithmetic instructions include addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and shifting operations, while logic operations include AND, OR, XOR, and NOT operations.
\
\
**Operands:**
\
The inputs of an ALU are the data to be operated on, called operands, and a code indicating the operation to be performed; the ALU's output is the result of the performed operation.
\
\
**Opcode:**
\
The opcode input is a parallel bus that conveys to the ALU an operation selection code, which is an enumerated value that specifies the desired arithmetic or logic operation to be performed by the ALU.

\
**The design includes:** 
\

Two inputs "a" and "b" [each 4 bits]


One "op" to set the operation to perform, [2 bits]


and one output as "result", [8 bits]
